# Starter Template or Existing Project

**Decision:** Custom monorepo setup with your preferred technologies rather than a starter template that might impose unwanted constraints.

**Rationale:** Since your PRD specifies React.js (not Next.js) + Express backend, a custom monorepo setup preserves your specific tech stack choices while providing the benefits of shared TypeScript types between frontend/backend, coordinated deployments, and simplified dependency management.
